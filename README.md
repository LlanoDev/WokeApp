# WokeApp

This Application will play a random song/speech from an audio API as your alarm.

# Introduction

WokeApp introduces a new approach to waking up by integrating audio data into its alarm clock. Traditional alarm clocks typically incorporate the antiquated idea that the most discordant noise will prove more efficient at waking someone up. WokeApp instead aims to provide a user experience that is exciting, healthier, and makes mornings more inspiring. Users will be able to customize their alarms to a genre of sound that is generally more agreeable with their mood and personality type. Each alarm randomly plays an audio file from the Spotify API - allowing users to discover new audio that they otherwise may never find.

# User Stories

1) As a user I can break free from the repeating headaches of 
uninspiring wakeup calls by choosing the genre of sound I would like to wake up to.

2) As a user I can passively discover new music with each alarm.

3) As a user I will find less incentive to turn off my alarm and fall back asleep if im engaged in what I am hearing.

# Technology

1) ReactJS
2) Ideally Soundcloud/Spotify API
